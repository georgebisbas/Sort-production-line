# Sort-production-line
Simple matlab code for transforming a 4-item order using swap or rotation.
This code was developed for educational purposes aiming to children between 12 and 15 years old.

# Goal
Suppose you have a production line where 4 items in order ABCD 
need to be placed in a specific order. A robot can only use 2 actions:
- swap the 2 first items (abcd->bacd)
- move last one first and 1st to 2nd and so on (abcd->dabc)

Try to find the combinations of moves in order to get your desired result
